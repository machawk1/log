excerpt: PhD student and research faculty were offered an opportunity to present their research at the CCI First Annual Research Showcase
---

<blockquote>
"Never miss an opportunity to present your research."
</blockquote>

I was advised of this (by <a href="https://x.com/phonedude_mln">@phonedude_mln</a>) while a PhD student. On May 28, 2024, the <a href="https://drexel.edu/cci/current-students/doctoral-students/cci-doctoral-student-association/">Drexel CCI Doctoral Student Association (DSA)</a> held the First Annual Research Showcase, which invited students, faculty, and others in the college to present and witness ongoing research by any students or faculty that opted to present.

I opted to present.

I have reiterated the advice that started this post to my PhD, <a href="https://choihywook.github.io/">Hyung Wook Choi</a>, who also opted to present.

This post is a summary of this brief event.

# The Event

![DSA logo >](/assets/2024-05-29/dsa-logo.png){: width="300" .centered }

The event commenced at 4 pm on the 10th floor of Drexel CCI in Philadelphia. The event was composed about a dozen student posters and a series of 8 5-minute lightning talks at 5 pm following the poster session.

## Poster Session

Attendees were able to walk around with refreshments for the first hour of the event and inquire about students' research as presented on the posters. I was able to visit a few of the posters and for some, talk with the students, to get a sense of their research.

<span class="person"><a href="https://www.laylab.me/">Layla Bouzoubaa</a></span> (<a href="https://x.com/Bouzoulay">@Bouzoulay</a>) presented, "Stigma: Classified Contextualized Encounters", a work-in-progress project that looks into the notion of stigma concerning drug use on online forums like various sub-Reddits.

# Closing and Acknowledgement

After Sonia's presentation and a slight pause to socialize, awards were presented to the three best posters, as evaluated by a panel of three judges.

Overall, the First Annual Research Showcase put on by Drexel CCI's Doctoral Student Association was a great chance to hear about students' and faculty's ongoing research as well as to get together in an informal setting to socialize with our CCI peers. I look forward to the DSA putting on this event again in 2025.
