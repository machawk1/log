-->For our research group, 2023 was eventful for both fortunate and unfortunate reasons. It is useful to review all that was encapsulated within the past twelve months for our perspective as well as to serve as a record of how we might improve in the future. This is the second in a series of yearly reviews (the first being the [review of 2022](year-in-review-2022)).

In this summary of 2023, I cover aspects relating to [students](#students), [funding](#funding), [dissemination](#dissemination), [teaching](#teaching), [service](#service), [upcoming endeavors](#upcoming), and [a personal aside](#personal).

Before starting with our own, I want to first acknowledge others' similar reports. This list will be amended inline as I become aware of them.

# Students

![Christopher Rauch >](/assets/2022-12-30/christopher-rauch.jpeg){: .mug}

Our research group is still composed of my two students, Christopher (Chris) Rauch ([@chris_2187](https://x.com/chris_2187)) and [Hyung Wook (Wook) Choi](https://choihywook.github.io/). Chris is now researching part-time with [Dr. Rosina Weber](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~rw37/) ([@rosinaweber](https://x.com/rosinaweber)) studying AI Ethics. We are hoping to move him to his Ph.D. candidacy proposal in the first half of 2024. He continues to lend his support and expertise to our IMLS-Web Ads grant (see [below](#webads)).

<br style="clear: both;">

![Hyung Wook Choi >](/assets/2022-12-30/hyung-wook-choi.jpeg){: .mug}

Wook is now in the second year of her Ph.D. as she continues to explore exploring semantic disambiguation across domains. In October 2023, she had a poster at the 17th International Conference on Metadata and Semantics Research ([MTSR 2023](http://www.mtsr-conf.org/home)). More details on that are in the [dissemination section](#dissemination) below.

## Beyond Advising

In support of students beyond those I advise, I was pleased to be involved on the committees and associated Ph.D. dissertation defenses of the now-Drs. Sam Grabus and Hanieh Razzaghi. Sam's defense was titled, "Historical Subject Representation: An Analysis of Historical Vocabularies for Temporally-Aligned and Contextual Access Points" and Hanieh's "Semantic Data Quality Assessment: An Investigation of Fitness for Use in Large Clinical Datasets". Congratulations to them both.

Additionally, I was pleased to be involved in the Ph.D. candidacy review of Drexel CCI Ph.D. student Deanna Zarrillo ([@zarrillogical](https://x.com/zarrillogical)), who was evaluated on the topics of computational social science, data policy &amp; ethics, and Science of Science. 

# Funding

![IMLS Logo >](/assets/2022-08-17-imls.jpeg){: .logo}

![Alex Poole, Drexel CCI collaborator >](/assets/2024-01-02/alex-poole.jpg){: .mug .hideonmobile}

In 2023, we continued our investigation of the <a href="https://www.imls.gov/">IMLS</a>-funded project titled "[Saving Ads: Assessing and Improving Web Archives' Holdings of Online Advertisements](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-252362-ols-22)". In collaboration with Drs. [Michele C. Weigle](https://weiglemc.github.io/) ([@weiglemc](https://x.com/weiglemc/)) and [Michael L. Nelson](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/) ([@phonedude_mln](https://x.com/phonedude_mln)) at [Old Dominion University](https://www.odu.edu/)'s [WS-DL Research Group](https://oduwsdl.github.io/), Dr. Alex H. Poole from [Drexel CCI](https://drexel.edu/cci/), and student support from Chris and Ph.D. student [Travis Reid](https://sites.google.com/view/treid803/home) ([@TReid803](https://x.com/TReid803)), we were able to explore some of the nuances of the past preservation and contemporary state of archiving advertisements on the web. A report of the first year of our findings as well as a pending follow-up investigation is described in the [Upcoming section](#upcoming) below.

![NSF Logo >](/assets/2024-01-02/nsf.png){: .logo}

Beyond the IMLS funding, I have been grateful to be involved in the NSF Science of Science: Discovery, Communication, and Impact (SoS:DCI)-supported project, "Examining the effects of academic mobility on individual professorsâ€™ research activity and institutional human capital at HBCUs" with members from the Drexel, UT-Knoxville, UW-Madison, and Howard University research communities. In 2023, this project wrapped up the data collection phase has started to analyze the trends of academic migration with respect to HBCUs. We had two such presentations from this project this year (see [below](#dissemination)).

![LEADING Logo >](/assets/2022-12-30/leading.png){: .logo}

Lastly, we wrapped up the [final cohort](https://mrc.cci.drexel.edu/leading/fellows/) of the IMLS-funded [LIS Education And Data Science Integrated Network Group (LEADING)](https://mrc.cci.drexel.edu/leading/) project in December 2023. An overview of "Next Steps..." for the project was presented at the [Coalition for Networked Information (CNI) Fall 2023 Membership Meeting](https://www.cni.org/events/membership-meetings/past-meetings/fall-2023).

# Dissemination

While our focus this year was on achieving sustainability of student support through grant writing, we continued to have a productive year for publications and research dissemination.

* An article detailing ODU MS student John Berlin's thesis was published and released in the [TWEB Journal](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589206).
* I was involved in a journal article with Dr. Jane Greenberg ([@all_metadata](https://x.com/all_metadata))) in the Data Intelligence journal titled, [Building Community Consensus for Scientific Metadata with YAMZ](https://direct.mit.edu/dint/article/5/1/242/115158/Building-Community-Consensus-for-Scientific).
* Wook and I had a poster at MTSR 2023 in Milan, Italy titled, "[On Identifying Points of Semantic Shift Across Domain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12369.pdf)" (linked preprint)
* [Erjia Yan](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~ey86/) ([@erjiayan](https://x.com/erjiayan)), Deanna Zarrillo, me, and others on the NSF-Funded project had a publication at [the 20th International Conference of the International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics (ISSI)](https://cns-iu.github.io/workshops/2023-07-02_issi/) titled, "[Examining the academic mobility at Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the U.S.](https://matkelly.com/papers/2023_issi_yan.pdf)".
* I also presented some preliminary findings from this project at the [International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC) Web Archiving Conference (WAC) 2023](https://netpreserve.org/ga2023/) titled, "[Using Web Archives to Model Academic Migration and Identify Brain Drain](https://matkelly.com/presentations/2023_iipcwac_braindrain.pdf)" (slides linked).
* Lastly, I lead an effort to hold the [Web Archiving and Digital Libraries (WADL) Workshop at JCDL 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266131) this year with the help of [Brenda Reyes Ayala](https://reyesayala.github.io/) ([@CamtheWicked](https://x.com/CamtheWicked/)), [Zhiwu Xie](https://www.zhiwuxie.com/) ([@zxie](https://x.com/zxie/)), [Ed Fox](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/) ([@edwardafox](https://x.com/edwardafox/)) and all of the attendants in Santa Fe, New Mexico. More information on this event is described in the [Travel](#travel) section.

# Teaching

Drexel is on the quarter system, which as tenure-track faculty, I teach three classes per year: one in each of Fall, Winter, and Spring. For this year-in-review, I will focus on the Winter (January-March), Spring (March-June), and Fall (September-December) 2023 quarters.

To start the year, I taught INFO102 - Introduction to Information Systems. Even as one with a computer science background, much of the content was fundamental to information systems, data handling, collaboration, and ethics. Inheriting a course shell on the material proved useful but even for the sizeable undergraduate class, there seemed to be minimal enthusiasm.

Spring quarter had me teaching INFO202 - Data Curation for the third time in my career at Drexel. With some previous evolution of the course by [Dr. Erjia Yan](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~ey86/) loosely based on [Ed Summers'](https://inkdroid.org/) Digital Curation course at UMD. The adaptation was going swimmingly, and the students seemed to prefer interactively working with data over ingesting lecture material. At one point during the term, a personal caveat (see [below](#personal) if interested) caused a hiccup in the presentation of this course. I was able to return to instruction with one final data-based assignment before wrapping up the school year for an unfortunately eventful Summer. I still owe Ed an email about these adaptations. There was a plan to have a separate blog post on the updates (and perhaps there eventually will be) but life got in the way of this instance.

![Elasticsearch Logo >](/assets/2024-01-02/elastic.png){: .logo}

In the Fall quarter of 2023, I taught INFO624: Information Retrieval Systems to a cross-listed course of 24 students, 12 of whom were in-person at Drexel CCI and 12 online. This was the fourth time I taught the course and incorporated some newer assignment material where students had a chance to become more familiar with [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch) through implementing concepts described in class.

# Travel 

![Cathedral Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi in Santa Fe, NM >](/assets/2024-01-02/santafe_cathedral.jpg){: .fullwidth}

![JCDL 2023 Logo >](/assets/2022-12-30/jcdl-2023.png){: .logo}

I had two travel events this year -- one to the [ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL) 2023](https://2023.jcdl.org/) in Santa Fe, New Mexico (where I was a [conference program chair](https://2023.jcdl.org/organizers/organizing-committee/#:~:text=Alamos%20National%20Laboratory-,Program%20Chairs,-Anat%20Ben%2DDavid)) (see [ODU WS-DL's Trip Report](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2023/07/2023-07-26-acmieee-joint-conference-on.html)) and one to Birmingham, UK to the [ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2023)](https://uobevents.eventsair.com/cikm2023/) where I was the publicity chair ([@cikm2023](https://x.com/cikm2023)) for the conference.

<br style="clear: both;">

![CIKM 2023 Logo >](/assets/2024-01-02/cikm.jpeg){: .logo}

Both were great opportunities to catch up with former colleagues, learn more about the  workings of an in-person conference, and interface with researchers investigating contemporary topics in their respective fields. Along with being an organizer at JCDL, I was also the lead in the [WADL Workshop](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/wadl2023.html) while there in person. We hosted a hybrid audience and presenters with self-admitted success and hope to hold the event again in the future. The fine folks at ODU WS-DL also have provided a report on [their experience of the workshop](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2023/08/2023-08-10web-archiving-and-digital.html).

<br style="clear: both;">

# Service

For disclosure, I prefer to be transparent about my service involvement in the various communities with which I have been involved over the year. In 2023, I was involved in the conference review process for [ACM WebSci 2023](https://websci23.webscience.org/), [iPRES 2023](https://ipres2023.us/), [ICADL 2023](https://icadl.net/icadl2023/), and [iConference 2024](https://www.ischools.org/iconference). I was also a reviewer for [Internet Histories](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/rint20) and the [SoftwareX](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/softwarex) journals. My involvement with the [International Journal on Digital Libraries (IJDL)](https://link.springer.com/journal/799) continues as [a managing editor](https://link.springer.com/journal/799/editors). Additionally, in 2023, I was also a funding reviewer for the [Dutch Research Council](https://www.nwo.nl/en).

For internal service to the Information Science department at Drexel CCI, I continue to assist with the MSIS Curriculum Committee, of which the course (INFO655) I am [teaching](#teaching) this winter (starting January 2024) is integrated.

# Upcoming

![IIPC WAC Logo >](/assets/2024-01-02/iipcwac-2024.png){: .logo}

In June 2024, we will be presenting our conference submission, "Saving Ads: Assessing and Improving Web Archivesâ€™ Holdings of Online Advertisements" at the IIPC Web Archiving Conference in Paris, France.

![IJDL Logo >](/assets/2024-01-02/ijdl.png){: .logo}

An invited, extended version of my [ICADL 2022](https://icadl.net/icadl2022/) paper titled, "[Aggregator Reuse and Extension for Richer Web Archive Interaction](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-21756-2_25)" has been accepted, revised, and will appear in a volume of the [International Journal on Digital Libraries (IJDL)](https://link.springer.com/journal/799) with the title, "Exploiting the Untapped Functional Potential of Memento Aggregators Beyond Aggregation".

![React >](/assets/2024-01-02/react.png){: .logo}

In 2024, I will be teaching an overhauled version of INFO655: Intro to Web Programming that will incorporate the newer paradigms involved in programming web applications using [React](https://react.dev/).

Lastly, regarding teaching, I am slated to again teach INFO202: Data Curation. I am hoping to complete the first instance of this course without any caveat (see [this year](#personal)'s below).

# Personal

Ebbs and flows this year. Some personal matters caused personal and professional hiccups this year. I am detailing them here for my record and closure for anyone who clicked the mention above.

![Benjamin >](/assets/2024-01-02/benjamin.jpg){: .logo}

While halfway through the term of teaching INFO202, on May 14, 2023, we took our 1-year-old Benjamin (introduced in the [Teaching Section of the 2023 Year-in-Review](https://log.lab.matkelly.com/year-in-review-2022#:~:text=in%20future%20iterations.-,In%20Spring%202022,-%2C%20I%20was%20on) to the emergency room where he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. Recently graduate Ph.D. student, now Dr. Deborah Garwood, was able to substitute in and teach multiple lectures of the course in its original form. For that I am grateful.

Nearly immediately after returning from JCDL 2023 in Santa Fe in July, I was hospitalized with severe chest pain that I thought surely was my end and part of the motivation for publishing a report like this, even if the mention was a subtext. It was chalked up to coronary vasospasm, of which I have no history. I am still uncertain if it has any relation to the travel.

![Yuri, Space Dog >](/assets/2024-01-02/yuri.jpg){: .logo}

As if July was not already punishing enough, on July 8th our finest canine [Yuri, Space Dog](https://matkelly.com/spaceDog), died after a long bout with a progressing cancer. He gave us over ten of his years was a good boy.

![Dr. Sean Kelly (brother), Eileen Kelly (grandma), Dr. Mat Kelly (me) >](/assets/2024-01-02/grandma.jpg){: .logo}

And lastly, as the year was coming to a close, my last remaining grandparent, Eileen Kelly of Pine Bush, New York passed away on December 18, 2023. This is where I put this post to a close.
