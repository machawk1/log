It was eventful year! In this post we detail news relating to students, funding, dissemination, and courses that occurred in 2022.
<!-- endexcerpt -->
It has taken three years of my association with [Drexel](https://drexel.edu/) but in 2022 I am happy to finally provide a report of the status of our efforts over the last year.

# Students

In 2022, PhD Student Christopher Rauch ([@chris_2187](https://twitter.com/chris_2187)) is continuing to explore his research topic and will be the primary Drexel student on our recently awarded IMLS grant. (TOADD: Chris image)

A new PhD student, [Hyung Wook Choi](https://choihywook.github.io/), has joined Chris and I to pursue her PhD, initially exploring semantic disambiguation across domains. Upon starting her trek at Drexel, she was also awarded the [Graduate College Doctoral Gold Fellowship](https://drexel.edu/graduatecollege/research-funding/fellowships/graduatecollege-fellowships/2022-fellows/).

# Funding

After a long period of negotiation, we were ability to solidify a collaboration between Drexel CCI and MITRE Corporation to build upon the "VENOM" project. Led by Dr. Justin F. Brunelle on the MITRE end and myself from Drexel, we sought to investigate methods for associating dark web URIs together and be able to provide a persistent identifier to solidify the association.

In late July 2022, I was information that our grant proposal to the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) relating to investigating the past and contemporary usage of ads on the web was funded! This collabroation with my PhD advisors, Drs. [Michele C. Weigle](https://weiglemc.github.io/) and Dr. [Michael L. Nelson](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/) from [ODU](https://www.odu.edu/), as well as my colleague, Dr. Alex H. Poole from Drexel CCI will support both Drexel and ODU students until 2024 to execute the grant tasks. More information about the grant can be had on the [grant summary page](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-252362-ols-22). (TOADD: IMLS image)

# Dissemination

On the dissemination front, Deanna Zarrillo ([@zarrillogical](https://twitter.com/zarrillogical)) from CCI's [Scholarly Communication Lab](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~ey86/lab.html) presented our work on an NSF Science of Science: Discovery, Communication, and Impact grant; lead by CCI's [Dr. Erjia Yan](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~ey86/) ([@erjiayan](erjiayan)), at the [Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&T) Annual Meeting 2022](https://www.asist.org/am22/) in Pittsburgh, PA. The [paper](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pra2.664), "Collecting Diachronic Affiliation Data for Faculty at HBCUs Using Memento", described some our efforts at exploring the phenomena of Brain Drain from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) by intiially leveraging web archives.

While still completing her MS prior to joining the PhD program, Hyung Wook Choi and I published a poster, "Examining Existing Approaches Toward Semantic Disambiguation" at the International Society for Knowledge Organization (ISKO) Conference 2022 in Allborg, Denmark in July. (TOADD: ISKO image)

In June 2022 at the ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries 2022, I helped organize the [Web Archiving and Digital Libraries (WADL) Workshop](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/wadl2022.html) [writeup](https://matkelly.com/papers/2022_wadl.pdf) along with Martin Klein ([@mart1nkle1n](https://twitter.com/mart1nkle1n)) from [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/) and both [Zhiwu Xie](https://www.zhiwuxie.com/) ([@zxie](https://twitter.com/zxie)) and [Edward A. Fox](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/) from [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/). At this workshop, we also presented our progress on the above NSF grant with a presentation titled, "[First steps in Identifying Academic Migration using Memento and Quasi-Canonicalization](https://matkelly.com/papers/2022_wadl_hbcus.pdf)". (TOADD: JCDL 2022 logo)

Finally, less than a month ago, I remotely presented my full paper, "Aggregator Reuse and Extension for Richer Web Archive Interaction" at the [International Conference on Asia-Pacific Digital Libraries (ICADL 2022)](https://icadl.net/icadl2022/), which was held in Hanoi, Vietnam. This is the first I have published after this conference, now having completed the DL conference trifecta of JCDL, TPDL, and ICADL. (TOADD: ICADL logo) (TODO: add trifecta logo)

# Teaching

In Winter 2022, I was grateful to be able to teach INFO624 Information Retrieval System for the third time at Drexel. I very much enjoy the course and hope to further incorpate interaction with ElasticSearch in future interations.

In Spring 2022, I was on research leave after having welcomed my son to the world on March 14, 2022.

Finally, in Fall 2022, I recently finished teaching INFO600 Web Systems & Architecture. This is also my third time teaching this class with each iteration being a different modality permutation: first as face-to-face, second as online due to the pandemic, and thirdly as a cross-listed online/face-to-face course.

# Upcoming

In 2023, I will be involved as a Program Chair in helping to organize the [ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries 2023](https://2023.jcdl.org/) in Sante Fe, New Mexico along with Dr. Martin Klein of LANL, [Dr. Robert J&auml;shke](https://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/de/institut/personen/jaeschke) of Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin, and [Dr. Anat Ben-David](https://www.anatbendavid.info/) ([@anatbd](https://twitter.com/anatbd)) of [Open University of Israel](https://www.openu.ac.il/en/pages/default.aspx). It is sure to be an exciting time come next June and I am looking forward to continually being involved in this conference in a new role. (TOADD: JCDL 2023 logo)

Additionally, at the invite of [Dr. Ingo Frommholz](http://www.frommholz.org/) [@iFromm](https://twitter.com/iFromm), I will be serving as the Publicity Chair on the Organizing Committee of the [ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) 2023](https://cikm2023.github.io/). More info to come on that conference as we move into the new year. (TOADD: CIKM 2023 logo)

# Ongoing

I am happy to continue my involvement with a few endeavors.

For starters, I am still very much involved with Dr. Jane Greenberg's IMLS-funded [LIS Education And Data Science Integrated Network Group (LEADING)](https://mrc.cci.drexel.edu/leading/) project where, in 2022, we had our second cohort of students. (TOADD: LEADING logo)

I am also grateful to contiunue to be involved as a Managing Editor for the [International Journal on Digital Libraries (IJDL)](https://www.springer.com/journal/799), where I am focusing on novel approaches toward publicity of the journal for soliciting new submissions. The Managing Editors, the Editorial Board, and a representative from Springer will meet on January 9, 2023 to discuss the state and future efforts for the journal. (TOADD: IJDL logo)

# Acknowledements

The barriers in publishing a yearly review are rigid and tough to overcome given the many other obligations of academia. For finally getting this post out-the-door I want to thank the motivation of [Dr. Jina Huh-Yoo](https://jinahuhyoo.com/), who has managed to publish [her year-in-review while at Drexel](https://jinahuhyoophd.medium.com/2021-year-in-review-health-and-happiness-design-lab-at-drexel-university-33971bb5da14) and also the [ODU WS-DL research group](https://ws-dl.cs.odu.edu), who continually publishes [such posts](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/search/label/WS-DL%20Review) each January.
