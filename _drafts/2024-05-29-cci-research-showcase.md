excerpt: PhD student and research faculty were offered an opportunity to present their research at the CCI First Annual Research Showcase

<blockquote>
"Never miss an opportunity to present your research."
</blockquote>

I was advised of this (by <a href="https://x.com/phonedude_mln">@phonedude_mln</a>) while a PhD student. On May 28, 2024, the <a href="https://drexel.edu/cci/current-students/doctoral-students/cci-doctoral-student-association/">Drexel CCI Doctoral Student Association (DSA)</a> held the First Annual Research Showcase, which invited students, faculty, and others in the college to present and witness ongoing research by any students or faculty that opted to present.

I opted to present.

I have reiterated the advice that started this post to my PhD, Hyung Wook Choi, who also opted to present.

This post is a brief summary of this brief event.
