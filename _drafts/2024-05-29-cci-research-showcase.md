excerpt: PhD student and research faculty were offered an opportunity to present their research at the CCI First Annual Research Showcase

<blockquote>
"Never give up an opportunity to present your research"
</blockquote>

I was advised of this (by @phonedude_mln) while a PhD student. On May 28, 2024, the Drexel CCI Doctoral Student Association (DSA) held the First Annual Research Showcase, which invited students, faculty, and others in the college to present and witness ongoing research by any students or faculty that opted to present.

I opted to present.

I have reiterated the advice that started this post to my PhD, Hyung Wook Choi, who also opted to present.

This post is a brief summary of this brief event.
