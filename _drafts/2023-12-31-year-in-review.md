Ebbs and flows &mdash; another eventful year but filled more with challenges than [2022](year-in-review-2022).
<!-- endexcerpt -->
It has taken three years of my association with [Drexel](https://drexel.edu/) but in 2022 I am happy to finally provide a report of the status of our efforts over the last year.

# Students

![Christopher Rauch >](/assets/2022-12-30/christopher-rauch.jpeg){: .mug}

In 2022, PhD Student Christopher Rauch ([@chris_2187](https://twitter.com/chris_2187)) is continuing to explore his research topic and will be the primary Drexel student on our [recently awarded IMLS grant](#funding).

<br style="clear: both;">

A new PhD student, [Hyung Wook Choi](https://choihywook.github.io/), has joined Chris and I to pursue her PhD, initially exploring semantic disambiguation across domains. Upon starting her trek at Drexel, she was also awarded the [Graduate College Doctoral Gold Fellowship](https://drexel.edu/graduatecollege/research-funding/fellowships/graduatecollege-fellowships/2022-fellows/).

# Funding

![Justin F. Brunelle >](/assets/2022-12-30/justin-f-brunelle.jpeg){: .mug}

After a long period of negotiation, we were ability to solidify a collaboration between Drexel CCI and MITRE Corporation to build upon the "VENOM: Archiving the Dark Web" project. Led by <a href="http://justinfbrunelle.com/">Dr. Justin F. Brunelle</a> on the MITRE end and myself from Drexel, we sought to investigate methods for associating dark web URIs together and be able to provide a persistent identifier to solidify the association. 

![IMLS Logo >](/assets/2022-08-17-imls.jpeg){: .logo}

In late July 2022, I was information that our grant proposal to the <a href="https://www.imls.gov/">Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS)</a> relating to investigating the past and contemporary usage of ads on the web was funded! This collaboration with my PhD advisors, Drs. [Michele C. Weigle](https://weiglemc.github.io/) ([@weiglemc](https://twitter.com/weiglemc/)) and [Michael L. Nelson](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/) ([@phonedude_mln](https://twitter.com/phonedude_mln)) from [ODU](https://www.odu.edu/), as well as my colleague, <a href="https://drexel.edu/cci/about/directory/P/Poole-Alex/">Dr. Alex H. Poole</a> from Drexel CCI will support both Drexel and ODU students until 2024 to execute the grant tasks. More information about the grant can be had on the [grant summary page](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-252362-ols-22).


# Dissemination

![ASIST Logo >](/assets/2022-12-30/asist.jpeg){: .logo}

On the dissemination front, Deanna Zarrillo ([@zarrillogical](https://twitter.com/zarrillogical)) from CCI's [Scholarly Communication Lab](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~ey86/lab.html) presented our work on an NSF Science of Science: Discovery, Communication, and Impact grant; lead by CCI's [Dr. Erjia Yan](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~ey86/) ([@erjiayan](https://twitter.com/erjiayan)), at the [Association for Information Science and Technology (ASIS&T) Annual Meeting 2022](https://www.asist.org/am22/) in Pittsburgh, PA. The [paper](https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/pra2.664), "Collecting Diachronic Affiliation Data for Faculty at HBCUs Using Memento", described some our efforts at exploring the phenomena of Brain Drain from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) by initially leveraging web archives. 

![ISKO 2022 Logo >](/assets/2022-12-30/isko-2022.jpeg){: .logo}

While still completing her MS prior to joining the PhD program, Hyung Wook Choi and I published a poster, "Examining Existing Approaches Toward Semantic Disambiguation" at the International Society for Knowledge Organization (ISKO) Conference 2022 in Aalborg, Denmark in July.

![JCDL 2022 Logo >](/assets/2022-12-30/jcdl-2022.jpeg){: .logo}

In June 2022 at the ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries 2022, I helped organize the [Web Archiving and Digital Libraries (WADL) Workshop](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/wadl2022.html) [write-up](https://matkelly.com/papers/2022_wadl.pdf) along with Martin Klein ([@mart1nkle1n](https://twitter.com/mart1nkle1n)) from [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/) and both [Zhiwu Xie](https://www.zhiwuxie.com/) ([@zxie](https://twitter.com/zxie)) and [Edward A. Fox](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/) from [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/). At this workshop, we also presented our progress on the above NSF grant with a presentation titled, "[First steps in Identifying Academic Migration using Memento and Quasi-Canonicalization](https://matkelly.com/papers/2022_wadl_hbcus.pdf)".

![ICADL 2022 Logo >](/assets/2022-12-30/icadl-2022.png){: .logo}

Finally, less than a month ago, I remotely presented my full paper, "[Aggregator Reuse and Extension for Richer Web Archive Interaction](https://matkelly.com/papers/2022_icadl_chaining.pdf)" at the [International Conference on Asia-Pacific Digital Libraries (ICADL 2022)](https://icadl.net/icadl2022/), which was held in Hanoi, Vietnam. This is the first I have published after this conference, now having completed the DL conference trifecta of JCDL, TPDL, and ICADL. 

# Teaching

Drexel is on the quarter system, which as tenure-track faculty, I teaching three class per year: one in each of Fall, Winter, and Spring. For this year-in-review, I will focus on Winter (January-March), Spring (March-June), and Fall (September-December) 2023 quarters.

To start the year, I taught INFO102 - Introduction to Information Systems. Even as one with a computer science background, much of the content was fundamental to information systems, data handling, collaboration, and ethics. Inheriting a course shell on the material proved useful but even for the sizeable undergraduate class, there seemed to bit minimal enthusiasm.

Spring quarter had me teaching INFO202 - Data Curation for the third time in my career at Drexel. With some previous evolution of the course by [Dr. Erjia Yan](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~ey86/) loosely based on [Ed Summers'](https://inkdroid.org/) Digital Curation (TOLINK) course at UMD. The adaptation was going swimmingly and the students seemed to prefer interactively working with data over ingesting lecture material.

(add pic of Benjamin, Erjia, Deborah, etc.)

On May 14, 2023 we took our 1-year-old Benjamin (introduced in the [Teaching Section of the 2023 Year-in-Review](https://log.lab.matkelly.com/year-in-review-2022#:~:text=in%20future%20iterations.-,In%20Spring%202022,-%2C%20I%20was%20on) to the emergency room where he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. I mention this here because the recently graduate PhD student, now Dr. Deborah Garwood, was able to substitute in and teach multiple lecture of the course in its original form. For that I am grateful. I was able to return to instruction with one final data-based assignment before wrapping up the school year for an unfortunately eventful Summer. I still owe Ed an email about these adaptation.

TOADD: student's defenses and progression

# An Eventful Summer

Summer is typically reserved for research, planning, writing, and preparing for the upcoming school year. As with Spring term, all was progressing as it should. At the end of June, 2023, I traveled to Santa Fe, New Mexico to assist with the [2023 ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries](https://2023.jcdl.org) as a [conference program chair](https://2023.jcdl.org/organizers/organizing-committee/#:~:text=Alamos%20National%20Laboratory-,Program%20Chairs,-Anat%20Ben%2DDavid). This was the first in-person conference I had attended since the Fall of 2019 due to the pandemic. It was great to catch up with former colleagues, learn more about the inner-working of an in-person conference

WADL.

# Acknowledgments

The barriers in publishing a yearly review are rigid and tough to overcome given the many other obligations of academia. For finally getting this post out-the-door I want to thank the motivation of [Dr. Jina Huh-Yoo](https://jinahuhyoo.com/), who has managed to publish [her year-in-review while at Drexel](https://jinahuhyoophd.medium.com/2021-year-in-review-health-and-happiness-design-lab-at-drexel-university-33971bb5da14), and also the [ODU WS-DL research group](https://ws-dl.cs.odu.edu), who continually publishes [such posts](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/search/label/WS-DL%20Review) each January.
