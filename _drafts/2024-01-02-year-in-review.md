SUMMARY HERE

Ebbs and flows &mdash; another eventful year but filled more with challenges than [2022](year-in-review-2022).
<!-- endexcerpt -->
2023 for our research group was eventful for both fortunate and unfortunate reasons. It is useful to review all that was encapsulated within the past twelve months for our own perspective as well as to serve as a record on how we might improve in the future. This is the second in a series of yearly reviews (the first being the [review of 2022](year-in-review-2022)).

TODO: brief summary of this post's contentns

Before starting with our own, I want to first acknowledge others':

* Michael Ekstand (new Drexel CCI faculty) [2023 in Review](https://md.ekstrandom.net/blog/2023/12/2023)

# Students

Our research group is still composed of my two students, Christopher (Chris) Rauch ([@chris_2187](https://x.com/chris_2187)) and Hyung Wook (Wook) Choi. Chris is now researching part-time with [Dr. Rosina Weber](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~rw37/) ([@rosinaweber](https://x.com/rosinaweber)) studying AI Ethics. We are hoping to move him to his PhD candidacy proposal in the first half of 2024. He continues to lend his support and expertise on our IMLS-Web Ads grant (see [below](#webads)).

Wook is now in the second year of her PhD as she continues to explore exploring semantic disambiguation across domains. In October 2023, she had a poster at the 17th International Conference on Metadata and Semantics Research ([MTSR 2023](http://www.mtsr-conf.org/home)). More details on that in the [dissemination section](#dissemination) below.

## Beyond Advising

In support of students beyond those I advise, I was pleased to be involved on the committees and associated PhD dissertation defenses of the now-Drs. Sam Grabus and Hanieh Razzaghi. Sam's defense was titled, "Historical Subject Representation: An Analysis of Historical Vocabularies for Temporally-Aligned and Contextual Access Points" and Hanieh's "Semantic Data Quality Assessment: An Investigation of Fitness for Use in Large Clinical Datasets". Congratulations to them both.

Additionally, I was pleased to be involved in the PhD candidacy review of Drexel CCI PhD student Deanna Zarrillo ([@zarrillogical](https://x.com/zarrillogical)), who was evaluated on the topics of computational social science, data policy &amp; ethics, and Science of Science. 

# Funding

In 2023, we continued our investigation of the <a href="https://www.imls.gov/">IMLS</a>-funded project titled "[Saving Ads: Assessing and Improving Web Archives' Holdings of Online Advertisements](https://www.imls.gov/grants/awarded/lg-252362-ols-22)". In collaboration with Drs. [Michele C. Weigle](https://weiglemc.github.io/) ([@weiglemc](https://x.com/weiglemc/)) and [Michael L. Nelson](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~mln/) ([@phonedude_mln](https://x.com/phonedude_mln)) at [Old Dominion University's](https://www.odu.edu/)'s [WS-DL Research Group](https://oduwsdl.github.io/), Dr. Alex H. Poole from [Drexel CCI](https://drexel.edu/cci/), and student support from Chris and PhD student [Travis Reid](https://sites.google.com/view/treid803/home) ([@TReid803](https://x.com/TReid803)), we were able to explore some of the nuances of the past preservation and contemporary state of archiving advertisements on the web. A report of the first year of our findings as well as a pending follow-up investigation is described in the [Upcoming section](#upcoming) section below.

![IMLS Logo >](/assets/2022-08-17-imls.jpeg){: .logo}

Beyond the IMLS funding, I have been grateful to be involved in the NSF Science of Science: Discovery, Communication, and Impact (SoS:DCI)-supported project, "Examining the effects of academic mobility on individual professors’ research activity and institutional human capital at HBCUs" with members from the Drexel, UT-Knoxville, UW-Madison, and Howard University research communities. In 2023, this project wrapped up the data collection phase and has started to analyze the trends of academic migration in respect to HBCU. We had two such presentations from this project this year (see [below](#dissemination)).

![NSF Logo >](/assets/2023-01-02-nsf.jpeg){: .logo}

![LEADING Logo >](/assets/2022-12-30/leading.png){: .logo}

Lastly, we wrapped up the [final cohort](https://mrc.cci.drexel.edu/leading/fellows/) of the IMLS-funded [LIS Education And Data Science Integrated Network Group (LEADING)](https://mrc.cci.drexel.edu/leading/) project in December 2023. An overview of "Next Steps..." for the project was presented at the [Coalition for Networked Information (CNI) Fall 2023 Membership Meeting](https://www.cni.org/events/membership-meetings/past-meetings/fall-2023).

# Dissemination

While our focus this year was on achieving sustainability of student support through grant writing, we continued to have a productive year for publications and research dissemnination.

* An article detailing ODU MS student John Berlin's thesis was published and released in the [TWEB Journal](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589206).
* I was involved in a journal article with Dr. Jane Greenberg (Drexel CCI) in the Data Intelligence journal titled, [Building Community Consensus for Scientific Metadata with YAMZ](https://direct.mit.edu/dint/article/5/1/242/115158/Building-Community-Consensus-for-Scientific).
* Wook and I had a poster at MTSR 2023 in Milan, Italy titled, "[On Identifying Points of Semantic Shift Across Domain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.12369.pdf)" (linked preprint)
* [Erjia Yan](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~ey86/) ([@erjiayan](https://x.com/erjiayan)),Deanna Zarrillo, me, and others on the NSF-Funded project had a publication at [the 20th International Conference of the International Society for Scientometrics and Informetrics (ISSI)](https://cns-iu.github.io/workshops/2023-07-02_issi/) titled, "[Examining the academic mobility at Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the U.S.](https://matkelly.com/papers/2023_issi_yan.pdf)".
* I also presented some preliminary findings from this project at the [International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC) Web Archiving Conference (WAC) 2023](https://netpreserve.org/ga2023/) titled, "[Using Web Archives to Model Academic Migration and Identify Brain Drain](https://matkelly.com/presentations/2023_iipcwac_braindrain.pdf)" (slides linked).
* Lastly, I lead an effort to hold the [Web Archiving and Digital Libraries (WADL) Workshop at JCDL 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266131) this year with the help of [Brenda Reyes Ayala](https://reyesayala.github.io/) ([@CamtheWicked](https://x.com/CamtheWicked/)), [Zhiwu Xie](https://www.zhiwuxie.com/) ([@zxie](https://x.com/zxie/)), [Ed Fox](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/) ([@edwardafox](https://x.com/edwardafox/)) and all of the attendants in Santa Fe, New Mexico. More information on this event is described in the [Travel](#travel) section.

![JCDL 2022 Logo >](/assets/2022-12-30/jcdl-2022.jpeg){: .logo}

In June 2022 at the ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries 2022, I helped organize the [Web Archiving and Digital Libraries (WADL) Workshop](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/wadl2022.html) [write-up](https://matkelly.com/papers/2022_wadl.pdf) along with Martin Klein ([@mart1nkle1n](https://twitter.com/mart1nkle1n)) from [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov/) and both [Zhiwu Xie](https://www.zhiwuxie.com/) ([@zxie](https://twitter.com/zxie)) and [Edward A. Fox](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/) from [Virginia Tech](https://www.vt.edu/). At this workshop, we also presented our progress on the above NSF grant with a presentation titled, "[First steps in Identifying Academic Migration using Memento and Quasi-Canonicalization](https://matkelly.com/papers/2022_wadl_hbcus.pdf)".

![ICADL 2022 Logo >](/assets/2022-12-30/icadl-2022.png){: .logo}

Finally, less than a month ago, I remotely presented my full paper, "[Aggregator Reuse and Extension for Richer Web Archive Interaction](https://matkelly.com/papers/2022_icadl_chaining.pdf)" at the [International Conference on Asia-Pacific Digital Libraries (ICADL 2022)](https://icadl.net/icadl2022/), which was held in Hanoi, Vietnam. This is the first I have published after this conference, now having completed the DL conference trifecta of JCDL, TPDL, and ICADL.

# Teaching

Drexel is on the quarter system, which as tenure-track faculty, I teach three classes per year: one in each of Fall, Winter, and Spring. For this year-in-review, I will focus on Winter (January-March), Spring (March-June), and Fall (September-December) 2023 quarters.

To start the year, I taught INFO102 - Introduction to Information Systems. Even as one with a computer science background, much of the content was fundamental to information systems, data handling, collaboration, and ethics. Inheriting a course shell on the material proved useful but even for the sizeable undergraduate class, there seemed to bit minimal enthusiasm.

Spring quarter had me teaching INFO202 - Data Curation for the third time in my career at Drexel. With some previous evolution of the course by [Dr. Erjia Yan](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~ey86/) loosely based on [Ed Summers'](https://inkdroid.org/) Digital Curation course at UMD. The adaptation was going swimmingly and the students seemed to prefer interactively working with data over ingesting lecture material. At one point during the term, a personal caveat (see [below](#below) if interested) caused a hiccup in the presentation of this course. I was able to return to instruction with one final data-based assignment before wrapping up the school year for an unfortunately eventful Summer. I still owe Ed an email about these adaptation. There was a plan to have a separate blog post on the updates (and perhaps there eventually will be) but life got in the way of this instance.

In Fall quarter of 2023, I taught INFO624: Information Retrieval Systems to a crosslisted course of 24 students, 12 of which were in-person at Drexel CCI and 12 online. This was the fourth time I taught the course and incorporated some newer assignment material where student had a chance to become more familiar with [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch) through implementing concepts described in class.

# Travel 

![JCDL 2023 Logo >](/assets/2022-12-30/jcdl-2023.png){: .logo}

I had two travel events this year -- one to the [ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL) 2023](https://2023.jcdl.org/) in Santa Fe, New Mexico (where I was a [conference program chair](https://2023.jcdl.org/organizers/organizing-committee/#:~:text=Alamos%20National%20Laboratory-,Program%20Chairs,-Anat%20Ben%2DDavid)) (see [ODU WS-DL's Trip Report](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2023/07/2023-07-26-acmieee-joint-conference-on.html)) and to Birmingham, UK to the [ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2023)](https://uobevents.eventsair.com/cikm2023/) where I was the publicity chair.

![CIKM 2023 Logo >](/assets/2022-12-30/cikm-2023.png){: .logo}

Both were great opportunities to catch up with former colleagues, learn more about the inner-working of an in-person conference, and interface with researchers investigating contemporary topics in the respective fields. Along with being an organizer at JCDL, I was also the lead in the [WADL Workshop](https://fox.cs.vt.edu/wadl2023.html) while there in-person. We hosted a hybrid audience and presenters with self-admitted success and hope to hold the event again in the future. The fine folks at ODU WS-DL also have provided a report on [their experience of the workshop](https://ws-dl.blogspot.com/2023/08/2023-08-10web-archiving-and-digital.html).

# Upcoming

In June 2024, we will be presenting our conference submission, "Saving Ads: Assessing and Improving Web Archives’ Holdings of Online Advertisements" at the IIPC Web Archiving Conference in Paris, France.

![IIPC WAC Logo >](/assets/2024-01-02/iipcwac-2024.png){: .logo}

An invited, extended version of my [ICADL 2022](https://icadl.net/icadl2022/) paper titled, "[Aggregator Reuse and Extension for Richer Web Archive Interaction](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-21756-2_25)" has been accepted, revised, and will appear in a volume of the [International Journal on Digital Libraries (IJDL)](https://link.springer.com/journal/799) with the title, "Exploiting the Untapped Functional Potential of Memento Aggregators Beyond Aggregation".

![IIPC WAC Logo >](/assets/2024-01-02/ijdl.png){: .logo}

In 2024, I will be teaching an overhauled version of INFO655: Intro to Web Programming that will incorporate the newer paradigms involved in programming web applications using [React](https://react.dev/).

![React >](/assets/2024-01-02/react.png){: .logo}

Lastly regarding teaching, I am slated to again teach INFO202: Data Curation. I am hoping to complete the first instance of this course without any caveat (see [this year](#personal)'s below).

# Service

For disclosure, I prefer to be transparent about my service involvement in the various communities with which I have been involved over the year. In 2023, I was involved in the conference review process for [ACM WebSci 2023](https://websci23.webscience.org/), [iPRES 2023](https://ipres2023.us/), [ICADL 2023](https://icadl.net/icadl2023/), and [iConference 2024](https://www.ischools.org/iconference). I was also a reviewer for [Internet Histories](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/rint20) and the [SoftwareX](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/softwarex) journals. My involvement with the [International Journal on Digital Libraries (IJDL)](https://link.springer.com/journal/799) continues as [a managing editor](https://link.springer.com/journal/799/editors). Additionally, in 2023, I was also a funding reviewer for the [Dutch Research Council](https://www.nwo.nl/en).

For internal service to the Information Science department at Drexel CCI, I continue to assist with the MSIS Curriculum Committeee, of which the course (INFO655) I am [teaching](#teaching) this winter (starting January 2024) is integrated.

# Personal

(add pic of Benjamin, Erjia, Deborah, etc.)

On May 14, 2023 we took our 1-year-old Benjamin (introduced in the [Teaching Section of the 2023 Year-in-Review](https://log.lab.matkelly.com/year-in-review-2022#:~:text=in%20future%20iterations.-,In%20Spring%202022,-%2C%20I%20was%20on) to the emergency room where he was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. I mention this here because the recently graduate PhD student, now Dr. Deborah Garwood, was able to substitute in and teach multiple lecture of the course in its original form. For that I am grateful.

# In Summary

* One new PhD student (Wook)
* One peer-reviewed full paper (ICADL)
* One peer-reviewed short paper (ASIS&T)
* One poster (ISKO)
* One workshop publication (WADL)
* One workshop organized (WADL)
* Two new grant awarded (IMLS NLG-L, MITRE-Venom) with the latter fully executed
* Two courses taught (INFO624, INFO600)

# Acknowledgments
