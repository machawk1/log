## Saving Ads: Assessing and Improving Web Archives' Holdings of Online Advertisements & Preserving Personalized Advertisements for More Accurate Web Archives

Advertisements have served as the basis for rich analysis by scholars in many fields, particularly in the humanities and social sciences. Arguably the mores and norms of a time and place can be surmised to some extent through examination of a body of ads, or more narrowly at least ads can provide interesting contextual information to items they surround. Although print publications used to be the dominant information distribution format, access to information and publications online is now the norm, and the threat of losing today's digital material mirrors the known loss of print material from the past. This foundational work allowed for quantitative and qualitative analysis of the current short-comings of archival copies of advertisements embedded in web pages. Through this project we began to determine how to improve software based tools to capture specific types of ads. Our project explored the paradox of having an abundance of information online at the same time we face the disappearance of digital artifacts. In physical archives, what "gets into" an archive reflects the values of particular institutions (and funding availability), as well as the professional judgement of archivists. The project extended a vital, timely initiative that addresses both the technological shortcomings of and human negligence in archiving advertisements embedded in web pages. The project focused on personalized ads -- those viewed on the live web by users and typically not surfaced for capture by archival crawlers.

## Modeling Semantic Shift Using Version Control Paradigms

This project introduces a version-controlled framework for managing how meanings evolve over time, addressing the challenge of semantic shift across disciplines. Unlike existing approaches that either detect changes without preserving history or document concepts without integrating detection, this framework treats each semantic state as a versioned entity, linked through provenance and enriched with fuzziness scores to capture ambiguity. By combining drift detection with versioning, it transforms semantic change into a traceable archival record. The result is a practical infrastructure that supports interdisciplinary research and long-term preservation of knowledge while maintaining conceptual clarity.

## HBCU Mobility

The project collected faculty affiliation data from 35 HBCUs with master- or doctoral-level programs. It used Internet Archive as the primary data source and LinkedIn, ORCID, and ProQuest as secondary data sources. The project linked large, heterogeneous corpora of faculty affiliation data, Carnegie Classification institution profile data, Web of Science publication and citation data, and survey and interview data. The linked data was used to conduct expansive, cross-domain examinations of the impact of academic moves on individual professors' research activity and institutional human capital. The project employed statistical modeling and historical comparisons in combination with surveys and interviews. The combination of quantitative and qualitative results provided evidence concerning both the causes of institutional human capital change at HBCUs and the effect of moves on professors' research activities. This project contributed new knowledge on academic mobility, particularly for minority-serving institutions (MSIs). The project designed an interactive visual dashboard to share project outputs broadly. The visual dashboard will be updated annually in September for three additional years beyond the conclusion of the project. The results of this project will provide insights for administrators and policy makers.

## IPARO Simulation and Evaluation - https://seniorproject.cci.drexel.edu/project/f3447740-0655-4766-a836-935aaaa732b8/

IPARO is a decentralized version tracking system using the existing primitives of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and IPNS (InterPlanetary Name System). IPARO proposes the concept of IPMT (InterPlanetary Media Types) and namespacing so that it can be used in other applications that require versioning, such as a wiki or a collaborative code tracking system. The proposed system does not rely on any centralized server for archiving or replay of the content and continues to allow aggregators to play their role from which both large and small archives can benefit and flourish. This project entails creating an implementation of the proposed system and evaluating the decentralized version tracking system in the context of web archives.

## YAMZ - Yet Another Metadata Zoo

YAMZ (pronounced "yams") is an open, crowdsourced metadata vocabulary and terminology platform-a "metadictionary" that spans all domains and types of metadata "speech," including names, values, units, and relationships. It enables users to browse, add, import, tag, and link terms, obtain permanent identifiers (ARK permalinks), and iteratively refine terminology via community dialog and voting

## VENOM: Archiving the Dark Web

MITRE's Venom Project is developing a framework for archiving the dark web. One of the core challenges to our research is tracking the Universal Resource Identifiers (URIs) – the .onion addresses – of dark web sites as they shift over time. The project team has developed a .onion canonicalization service to help monitor and track the .onions over time. The Contractor is expected to construct a prototype persistent identifier for dark web sites (and their .onion URLs). The prototype should work with dark web sites as well as personalized surface web sites.
